# Original Concept

The idea for Building Chemistry Together came from asking a few students who were about to gradutate from GCU in the spring of 2018 if there were any major tools or applications that they wish they had while studying. One idea that came up several times was the idea of having an application that could display 3D models. From there, it was a matter of figuring out which game engine or IDE would be best suited for creating the program.

# Current Development

Development of the actual application was not a easy one. There were many different mindsets that conflicted with what we were taught during .NET and other Object Orientated concepts. Unity also has a massive backlog of methods and inner workings that are not well apparent or easy to track down. 
What held back development the most were a number of personal issues and outside factors that made development hard to keep up with as they were a large toll on the developerâ€™s mental and emotional well being. 
Despite that, once things have settled down, development was able to resume and a few features were able to be implemented in the end, though this version of the product is far from being suitable for a release state. Development will continue on during the summer.
