# Original Concept

The idea for Building Chemistry Together came from asking a few students who were about to gradutate from GCU in the spring of 2018 if there were any major tools or applications that they wish they had while studying. One idea that came up several times was the idea of having an application that could display 3D models. From there, it was a matter of figuring out which game engine or IDE would be best suited for creating the program.

# Current Development
The main approach toward development was to follow a somewhat parallel to the MVC framework. Starting with creating classes for each element: 

'''public class H : MonoBehaviour
{
    //Constructor to apply values to each variable.
    public H(string name, int publicNumber, int valance, int protons, int neutrons, int electrons, double mass, string trivia)
    {
        this.name = "Hydrogen";
        this.publicNumber = 1;
        this.valance = 1;
        this.protons = 1;
        this.neutrons = 0;
        this.electrons = 1;
        this.mass = 1.008;
        this.trivia = "This is hydrogen.";
    }
   
    public string name { get; set; }        // The name of the element
    public int publicNumber { get; set; }   // The number of the element
    public double mass { get; set; }        // The atomic mass
    public int valance { get; set; }        // The number of valance electrons
    public Vector3 valancePOS { get; set; } // The positions of the valance electrons
    public GameObject Hydrogen = GameObject.CreatePrimitive(PrimitiveType.Sphere);  //Which type of prefab is to be created.
    public int RayD = 1;                    // ???
    public LayerMask Test;                  // ??
    public int protons { get; set; }        // Number of Protons 
    public int neutrons { get; set; }       // Number of Neutrons
    public int electrons { get; set; }      // Number of Electrons
    public string trivia { get; set; }      // Trivia or interesting fact.
}'''

What held back development the most were a number of personal issues and outside factors that made development hard to keep up with as they were a large toll on the developerâ€™s mental and emotional well being. 
Despite that, once things have settled down, development was able to resume and a few features were able to be implemented in the end, though this version of the product is far from being suitable for a release state. Development will continue on during the summer.
